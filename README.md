# Automatic subtitles in your videos

This project is also based on [this incredible work](https://github.com/m1guelpf/auto-subtitles) by [m1guelpf](https://github.com/m1guelpf). I say "also" because I have an [other project](https://github.com/newtondotcom/auto-subtitle) much closer to the original one, which I have added to the possibility to use speaker diarization to recognize who is speaking in the video.
